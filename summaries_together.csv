"It seems surreal to me, said Elon Musk, proprietor of SpaceX, and for once he was understating things. Customers may be hard to come by for the Falcon Heavy. Conceivably, the Falcon Heavy could even transport people to the moon, at a fraction of the expected cost of an SLS launch.  FALCON Heavy, the highly anticipated SpaceX rocket, blasted into orbit on Tuesday as Elon Musk rewrote the history books with the incredible feat. Here are all the facts you need to know about the Falcon Heavy and Tesla roadster launch.  The rocket is carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roadster.  There was some confusion that Elon Musk was sending the Tesla to Mars.  Falcon Heavy's successful launch opened a new chapter for SpaceX.  After its modification, the design and development of the Falcon 9 together with Falcon Heavy would finally reach completion. For the meantime, SpaceX continues to render services through the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.  Two times now, SpaceX has sent a Dragon cargo capsule to space and back two times. The Falcon 9 booster used on this summer on the CRS-11 mission to the ISS was again fired up in December.  The the maiden launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket system later this month, will, among other things, send Musk's old Tesla Roadster to Mars.

"It seems surreal to me, said Elon Musk, proprietor of SpaceX, and for once he was understating things.  Known as the Falcon Heavy, the new projectile has 27 engines generating 5 million pounds of thrust, making it the most powerful rocket ever built by a private company. Musk's rival space-billionaire, Jeff Bezos, is also building a new heavy-lift rocket. SpaceX is already at work on its next generation, the BFR, which it expects will one day transport people to Mars. government, incongruously, is building its own behemoth, the Space Launch System, at a cost of some $23 billion and counting. Customers may be hard to come by for the Falcon Heavy. Conceivably, the Falcon Heavy could even transport people to the moon, at a fraction of the expected cost of an SLS launch.  FALCON Heavy, the highly anticipated SpaceX rocket, blasted into orbit on Tuesday as Elon Musk rewrote the history books with the incredible feat. Here are all the facts you need to know about the Falcon Heavy and Tesla roadster launch. That is 45 per cent more expensive than the Falcon 9 rocket in 2012.  Despite the cost, SpaceX have said it is actually a competitive price.  The rocket is carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roadster. If it had stayed on course, it would have drifted through space - potentially for millions of years.  There was some confusion that Elon Musk was sending the Tesla to Mars.  And the success of the launch has given billionaire Mr Musk hope for more advancement in the future.  Falcon Heavy's successful launch opened a new chapter for SpaceX.  After its modification, the design and development of the Falcon 9 together with Falcon Heavy would finally reach completion.  Elon Musk's personal Tesla might have gotten all the headlines during SpaceX's historic rocket launch last week, but the Falcon Heavy also carried a second, secret payload almost nobody knew about. For the meantime, SpaceX continues to render services through the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.  Scott Pace, Executive Secretary of the National Space Council, has said when the budget is released it will explain the US Government's future plans for the ISS and other space operations.

Here are all the facts you need to know about the Falcon Heavy and Tesla roadster launch. That is 45 per cent more expensive than the Falcon 9 rocket in 2012.   The idea was for the Falcon Heavy to propel the car into an orbit around the sun that approximates the orbit of Mars (but without the risk of it actually crashing into Mars). If it had stayed on course, it would have drifted through space - potentially for millions of years.  There was some confusion that Elon Musk was sending the Tesla to Mars. “But fortunately, that’s not what happened.”  A SpaceX rocket explosion has destroyed a launch pad before.  Known as the Big Falcon Rocket, the new vehicle outgrows its predecessor's two-stage system.  Falcon Heavy's successful launch opened a new chapter for SpaceX.

In one major project the organisation has teamed up with entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX.  On Saturday afternoon, SpaceX, the company started by Elon Musk in 2002 that has the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars, shared a photo of the capsule. The Falcon 9 booster used on this summer on the CRS-11 mission to the ISS was again fired up in December.  Two times now, SpaceX has sent a Dragon cargo capsule to space and back two times.

1,"It seems surreal to me, said Elon Musk, proprietor of SpaceX, and for once he was understating things. Musk's rival space-billionaire, Jeff Bezos, is also building a new heavy-lift rocket. government, incongruously, is building its own behemoth, the Space Launch System, at a cost of some $23 billion and counting. Satellites are getting smaller and lighter, while improvements in engine technology mean that smaller rockets -- such as SpaceX's Falcon 9 -- can handle bigger payloads. Customers may be hard to come by for the Falcon Heavy. Conceivably, the Falcon Heavy could even transport people to the moon, at a fraction of the expected cost of an SLS launch.  Even if the Falcon Heavy becomes obsolete, in other words, it will represent an important landmark in the grand American space experiment. Once again, SpaceX has tried something unreasonable -- surreal, even -- and once again, it has prevailed.",150,150,tf
2,"FALCON Heavy, the highly anticipated SpaceX rocket, blasted into orbit on Tuesday as Elon Musk rewrote the history books with the incredible feat. Here are all the facts you need to know about the Falcon Heavy and Tesla roadster launch. That is 45 per cent more expensive than the Falcon 9 rocket in 2012.  The rocket is carrying Elon Musk’s red Tesla Roadster.   The idea was for the Falcon Heavy to propel the car into an orbit around the sun that approximates the orbit of Mars (but without the risk of it actually crashing into Mars).  There was some confusion that Elon Musk was sending the Tesla to Mars. “But fortunately, that’s not what happened.”  A SpaceX rocket explosion has destroyed a launch pad before.",131,150,tf
3,"Falcon Heavy's successful launch opened a new chapter for SpaceX. Upon the completion of both projects, there would be nothing left to work on except for the BFR.  Musk claimed that his team has already gained a better understanding of reusable booster technology, allowing them to not just upgrade existing rockets but also to streamline the BFR for space exploration.  After its modification, the design and development of the Falcon 9 together with Falcon Heavy would finally reach completion. After this, the BFR will then conduct the same test on the moon.  Its spaceship component and launch system are designed to sit atop an enormous booster propelled by 31 Raptor engines. In comparison, the Falcon Heavy is only powered by 27 Merlin engines. For the meantime, SpaceX continues to render services through the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.",142,150,tf
4," The Arch looks like a shrunk-down DVD or Blu-ray, but its potential for data storage goes way beyond any optical discs you have in your home.  But even more impressive than the data capacity is the physical longevity of the medium – the first two discs, called Arch 1.1 and Arch 1.2, are said to be two of the longest-lasting storage objects ever created by humans, theoretically stable for up to 14 billion years, thanks to '5D data storage' inscribed by laser nanostructuring in quartz silica glass.  By eventually connecting the Arch Libraries, and the Arch storage devices they contain, through a decentralised read-write data sharing network that spans the Solar System, we can begin to grow and share a collective decentralised library of everything humanity learns, on every planet in our Solar System, and even beyond, as we spread, Spivack says.",146,150,tf
5,"Donald Trump's administration could announce in their proposed budget that they intend to cease funding for operations to the ISS by 2025.  Scott Pace, Executive Secretary of the National Space Council, has said when the budget is released it will explain the US Government's future plans for the ISS and other space operations.  We want to utilise the space station as much as we can in the remaining time it has and we want to think about what we do next with our partners, both commercial and international.  Senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the space subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said: There are reports that the administration's new budget would suggest that federal funding for the ISS would expire in 2025.",126,150,tf
6,"Two times now, SpaceX has sent a Dragon cargo capsule to space and back two times.  On Saturday afternoon, SpaceX, the company started by Elon Musk in 2002 that has the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars, shared a photo of the capsule. It sent up 4,800 pounds of cargo when it launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on December 15 as part of the science-filled CRS-13 mission. The Falcon 9 booster used on this summer on the CRS-11 mission to the ISS was again fired up in December.  The reusability didn't stop with the Dragon capsule for this mission. There's no Dragon capsule that's been used three times - yet. The first time a SpaceX capsule made two trips to the ISS was in September 2014 and then in June 2017 (on the aforementioned CRS-11 mission).",141,150,tf
7,"Says Epstein: This isn't a diplomatic breakthrough. Because to win, Dems will have to take territory that Hillary Clinton could not.  Nowhere did Tuesday's launch of Elon Musk's SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket echo as powerfully as in Russia, says Bloomberg's Leonind Bershidsky. In fact, Musk now has the most capable missile in the world, capable of delivering up to 64 tons into orbit. But the FBI's long record of selflessness and dedication is clearly not what Republicans are criticizing. New York already imposes four taxes on individuals and their employers who buy health insurance. Cuomo wants an additional 14 percent surcharge on private health-insurance companies. The insanely high cost of their private insurance has risen an almost unbelievable 5 percent per year over the past eight years. Which may be exactly what Cuomo wants - so that more people move to government health insurance.",146,150,tf
8,"Elon Musk's Boring Company has presented plans to build a tunnel under Culver City, California for a Hyperloop-like transport system.  She said: The purpose of Boring Company is to alleviate soul-destroying traffic and augment public transit.  A report by the Culver City manager's office stated: The Boring Company has proposed a privately funded human transportation tunnel that would run underneath the Westside of Los Angeles.  Ms Balajadia stressed that the company was not looking for public funding and that the cost to passengers would be comparable to, or less than existing forms of public transit in the region.  Last July, the company said that it was expecting to start digging by the end of 2017.",120,150,tf
